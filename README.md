## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm just a beginner and this project helped me learn lot of things like:
- I learned how to use the QR Code API to generate a QR code from a string of text.
- I learned how to use CSS to style the QR code image.
- I learned how to use HTML to create a responsive layout for the QR code component.
- I learned how to use Tailwind CSS to quickly and easily style my HTML elements.
- I learned how to use the CDN to load external resources, such as fonts and JavaScript libraries.

Overall, I found this small component to be a great way to learn some basic HTML, CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind css Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I'm just starting out and this helped me to quickly style the html elements.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
